                                        "Over 9000!" is one of the contests regularly hosted by the PMC. Here, participants 
                                        answer questions of the form "Is $x$ over 9000?", where $x$ is defined differently 
                                        each time. Usually, free snacks and dinner are provided, along with prizes for both 
                                        winners and losers. Prizes, what snacks are provided, what is served 
                                        for dinner, and the exact rules are at the host's discretion and 
                                        will be explained at the beginning of the event.
