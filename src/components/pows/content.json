Thanks xoxo\n\n# Problem\n\nThe squares of a chessboard are numbered as shown. Eight numbers are\nrandomly chosen sothere is one in each row and each column.\n\nShow the sum of these numbers is always the same.

If it's even, divide it by two. If it's odd, \nmultiply it by three and add one. Iterate this process over and over again.\n\nThe **Collatz Conjecture** hypothesizes that this process reaches 1 after only a finite number\nof iterations (and then cycles through 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1 etc). Interestingly, this is only a conjecture -\ndespite our advancements in modern mathematics, no one has been able to definitively prove whether this is true,\nor find a counterexample, despite the simplicity of this problem.\n\nDon't worry - we won't ask you to prove the conjecture here, but we will do something similar.\n\n# Problem: the \"DIY\" conjecture\n\nThis week, we want you to find a rule that is sort of like the Collatz rule, but\nbased on divisibility by a number other than 2.\n\nFormally, for some $k > 2$, we can define a Collatz rule by their general form\n- $kn \\rightarrow n$;\n- $kn + 1 \\rightarrow \\text{multiply and add something to (kn+1)}$;\n- $kn + 2 \\rightarrow \\text{multiply and add something to (kn+2)}$,\nand so on.\n\nIn other words, create a \"Linear Collatzian\" rule of size $k > 2$ that reaches 1 in\na finite number of steps (for like the first 500 numbers).\n\n# Bonuses (wait, there's more??)\n\n## Bonus\nFind more than one rule!\n\n## Extra Bonus\nWrite a program that finds and checks rules!\n\n## Super Bonus\nFind a (non trivial) way of generating a family of rules!\n\n## MEGA Bonus\nWhich rules only have one cycle? Which ones have a few cycles? Do some of them have\na finite or infinite number of cycles?\n\n## EPICC Bonus\nWhat makes a rule more likely to reach 1 for more numbers? What makes it more likely to have longer\n(though still finite) sequences before reaching 1? Why?","5":"\nHey math-folk!\n\nLet's switch gears this fortnight to the study of secrecy\nand intelligence; in other words, CRYPTOGRAPHY and\nBenebottom Cucumber's razor sharp cheekbones.\n\nTo be honest, these problems are my only motivation to keep\ndoing math while my soul gets sucked out during co-op, so\nthe themes tend to stick to whatever I'm reading that week.\nSo thank you to everyone who's been keeping up with this\nhalf-blog, half-POW (get it? because it's once every two weeks\n:3) train ride.\n\nThis week, I've got a fun teaser that no mathlete lesser than\nAlan Turing himself could solveâ€¦ at least, so far.
