Worked pretty hard on this sexy little puzzle üíÉ (ie. there wasn't an "answer at the back of the book" that I could look up this week), so be sure to give this one a try...

Try it, if not for the prizes, but for the eternal glory of claiming a piece of mathematical history ‚ú®!

# Background

Choose any natural number. If it's even, divide it by two. If it's odd, 
multiply it by three and add one. Iterate this process over and over again.

The **Collatz Conjecture** hypothesizes that this process reaches 1 after only a finite number
of iterations (and then cycles through 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1 etc). Interestingly, this is only a conjecture -
despite our advancements in modern mathematics, no one has been able to definitively prove whether this is true,
or find a counterexample, despite the simplicity of this problem.

Don't worry - we won't ask you to prove the conjecture here, but we will do something similar.

# Problem: the "DIY" conjecture

This week, we want you to find a rule that is sort of like the Collatz rule, but
based on divisibility by a number other than 2.

Formally, for some $k > 2$, we can define a Collatz rule by their general form
- $kn \rightarrow n$;
- $kn + 1 \rightarrow \text{multiply and add something to (kn+1)}$;
- $kn + 2 \rightarrow \text{multiply and add something to (kn+2)}$,
and so on.

In other words, create a "Linear Collatzian" rule of size $k > 2$ that reaches 1 in
a finite number of steps (for like the first 500 numbers).

# Bonuses (wait, there's more??)

### Bonus
Find more than one rule!

### Extra Bonus
Write a program that finds and checks rules!

### Super Bonus
Find a (non trivial) way of generating a family of rules!

### MEGA Bonus
Which rules only have one cycle? Which ones have a few cycles? Do some of them have
a finite or infinite number of cycles?

### EPICC Bonus
What makes a rule more likely to reach 1 for more numbers? What makes it more likely to have longer
(though still finite) sequences before reaching 1? Why?

# Solutions

This problem first asked to find a ‚Äúlinear Collatzian‚Äù rule of
size $k \le 3$. Needless to say, the winners went way beyond what
I expected, and came up with some beautiful pictures.

Mcpenguin's first instinct when approaching this problem
was, naturally, to make an entire freaking website about Linear
Collatz rules. I highly encourage you to check it out [here](https://linear-collatz.herokuapp.com/).
I am absolutely in love with the colors and wiggly paths. In fact, the cover picture for this
POW is a screenshot from his website!

The interface is fairly simple to figure out, and the website is great for identifying
cycles. I've lost a few hours at prod night just playing around
with this. Don't tell the editors. I'm working hard!! Anyways,
well done to mcpenguin.

<summary>Vincent's Solution</summary>

For Vincent, on the other hand, plain ol‚Äô natural numbers were
just too boring. Besides looking at cycles that include negative
numbers (those come out pretty quick even for the OG Collatz
Rule), they asked the question of applying the functions to
complex numbers. Now the picture becomes a hell of a lot
more chaotic. Here are some highlights:

I'll leave the pleasure of figuring out what's going on in these
images to you.
