Hey math-folk!

Let's switch gears this fortnight to the study of secrecy
and intelligence; in other words, CRYPTOGRAPHY and
Benebottom Cucumber's razor sharp cheekbones.

To be honest, these problems are my only motivation to keep
doing math while my soul gets sucked out during co-op, so
the themes tend to stick to whatever I'm reading that week.
So thank you to everyone who's been keeping up with this
half-blog, half-POW (get it? because it's once every two weeks
:3) train ride.

This week, I've got a fun teaser that no mathlete lesser than
Alan Turing himself could solveâ€¦ at least, so far. Try your luck! 

# Problem
Decipher the following message:
```

OIE XUPV RNS?
```

# Hints:
1. !!The cipher name tells you the cipher key!!
2. !!Google is encouraged!!
3. !!www.101computing.net is helpful for the last line!!

# Solution
!!Solution would go here!!
