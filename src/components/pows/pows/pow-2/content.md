Hey folks!

Welcome back. Did I subconsciously choose this problem
because I’m behind on all my work and I was rushing to scrape
something together for this issue, you ask? Great question.
Let’s take a look at this week’s problem.

# Problem

Can you divide a watch face into 6 parts with straight lines
so that each part contains 2 numbers and the six sums of 2
numbers are equal?

A clock face is provided above as a reference, 
in case you don't know what a watch looks like :p
