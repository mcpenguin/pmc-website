Hey math-folk!
It's the last Problem of the Week! I will be giving out x amount
of moneys as prize for this one, where x = (total money
budgeted for POW's this term) - (total money I've already
spent idk I haven't checked).

If you've seen it before, you've seen it a million times. If you've
never seen it before, this is a wonderful treat of a problem:

Define: **A rational number** is any real number that can be
written as a quotient of two integers.

Define: An **irrational number** is a real number that is not
rational.

# Problem
Prove or disprove: If $a$ and $b$ are irrational, then $a^b$ is
irrational.

# Additional Notes

(I couldn't find the original mathematician(s) who posed and
answered this question but I recently came across it again in Professor
Marcoux's lecture notes so that's who I'm citing.)
