#### Key Dates
- Ratified 15 Nov 2002
- Amended 6 November 2018
- Amended 11 March 2019
- Amended 4 April 2020

## 0. Preamble
We, the members of this club, find it self-evident that there is no preamble. In the formation of a just club, we find it necessary and sufficient to thank Reza for his continued support.

## 1. Name
The name of this organization shall consist of the word "The", followed immediately by a nonempty unordered subset of {"Pure Math", "Applied Math", "Combinatorics and Optimization"}, and terminated with the word "Club", until such a point in each academic term when funding from MathSoc is approved, at which point "Club" may be replaced by "Collective"; or any sane abbreviation for the above, according to the whims of the executive officers (cf. 4).

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of the Pure Math Club is to exist for all eternity. It shall achieve this by ratifying and submitting this document.

## 3. Membership
Membership to the Pure Math Club shall be open to all sentient beings. Membership shall not be extended to beings until a membership fee, set by the executive officers (cf. 4), has been paid. The membership lasts until the end of the universe, subject to cancellation by the executive officers (cf. 4) which is usually the end of each term.

### 3.1 Duties
Members of the Pure Math Club shall endeavour to be nice (in general, and to other members in particular).

### 3.2 Presidents for Life
Membership of Presidents, current or previous, cannot be cancelled. (Cf. 4)

## 4. Executive Officers
This club shall be ruled by the executive officers in a proxiseptumvirate (henceforth referred to as "the Triumvirate") consisting of:
- President
- Vice-President of Pure Math
- Vice-President of Applied Math
- Vice-President of Combinatorics and Optimization
- Vice-President of Pop
- Vice-President of Finances
- Secretary

### 4.1. Duties
The Triumvirate has no duties other than upholding this constitution.

### 4.2. Powers
During their tenure, the Triumvirate shall have absolute power over its operations and those of the PMC. The distribution of power among the members of the Triumvirate shall be determined by the Triumvirate in whatever way they see fit.

### 4.3. Selection of Executive Officers
The Triumvirate shall be elected at a disorganizational meeting at the beginning of each academic term. Selection shall be democratic unless decided otherwise by the membership.

### 4.4. Tenure
The Triumvirate shall hold their positions until the disorganizational meeting at the beginning of the subsequent term. (Cf. 3.2)

## 5. Subordinate Officers
Subordinate officers may be appointed any time at the pleasure of the Triumvirate, to perform such duties as the Triumvirate sees fit. These appointments shall last until the deposement or other removal of the Triumvirate. Ideally, all members and select non-members shall be subordinate officers during the disorganizational meeting; however, this maximal ideal may be freely quotiented by the Triumvirate, should it so choose.

### 5.1. Powers
Subordinate officers shall have no powers or privileges other than those explicitly granted by the Triumvirate.

## 6. Amendments
Amendments to this document may be made by the president with approval of two other members of the Triumvirate, or by any four members of the Triumvirate, at any time and are neither obligated to be made in any structured fashion, nor required to preserve the content or spirit of any past version of the document. 

## 7. Dissolution
In the event of the dissolution of the club, all assets of the club shall be transferred to the Flat Earth Society, with the exception of any remaining debts, which shall be transferred to MathSoc.

## 8. Axiom of Choice
The PMC officially endorses the Axiom of Choice and all consequences thereof. Any member who does not accept said Axiom shall be scorned nicely by other members.

## 9. Banach-Tarski Paradox
The PMC officially endorses the Axiom of Choice and all consequences thereof. Any member who does not accept said Axiom shall be scorned nicely by other members.

## 10. MathSoc Conspiracy Against the Environment
The PMC is officially disgruntled at MathSoc for their Luddite demand that the November 2002 constitution be submitted on paper. It is resolved that we shall remain officially disgruntled until such time as MathSoc submits to the Triumvirate a 1500 to 2000 word essay on the topic, 'Why we are ashamed that our previous reluctance to accept an electronic copy of the PMC constitution is directly responsible for clearcutting in British Columbia.'

## 11. Club Office
The PMC officially recognizes the Pure Math Club Office (MC 3033) as a place of worship, of indeterminate religious affiliation. Every member is invited to make the customary pilgrimage to the Third Floor of the Mathematics and Computer Building at least once in their life, and observe the Sacred Blackboard during irregular service hours.

### 11.1. Door Code Distribution
The PMC considers it a basic sentient-being right to be denied the PMC office door code. All beings, members and non-members alike, may request the current door code from the Triumvirate, to be denied at the Triumvirate's leisure.

## 12. Emergency Powers Clause
In the event of an emergency which renders PMC unable to properly hold the termly disorganizational meeting, the Triumvirate may, with the consent of MathSoc Council, extend their tenure for an academic term. If after the additional term the emergency is not over, the Triumvirate may extend their tenure for another term by obtaining the consent of MathSoc Council once again, and may repeat this for as many terms as needed until the emergency is over. If MathSoc Council is unable to give the Triumvirate a decision, then the Triumvirate's terms may be extended until MathSoc Council makes a decision, and the Triumvirate shall badger MathSoc Council into giving a decision until MathSoc Council does so.

Furthermore, at the time of a term extension, any member of the Triumvirate who is unable or unwilling to continue with their term may end their term at that point, and the remaining Triumvirate members may appoint a replacement.
